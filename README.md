# Gold-Price-Prediction-using-Neural-Network

## Introduction
This project explores the application of Neural Networks for predicting gold prices.By training the network on historical gold price data and relevant features, we aim to create a predictive model that can anticipate future price movements.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes historical data of various features, such as stock market indices (SPX), oil prices (USO), currency exchange rates (EUR/USD), and more. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a specific date and the associated feature values.

## Results
On evaluating the trained Neural Network model's performance for gold price prediction, an R2 score of 0.7017 was achieved
